your mom could probably make better viet food than this. however it's pretty much the only vietnamese option in this small town so go for it
i absolutely love the vibes of this place (specifically the one downtown). the baristas were super chill, the ambiance was SUPER relaxed and i loved the fact that there weren't a lot of college kids studying, but more older folks enjoying their morning coffee.
rumor has it that Tom is still waiting for his pizza he ordered 2 weeks ago
you could probably make the stuff they sell for $5 if you go to ralph's. but if you wanna treat urself then go for it ig
this place has fr improved since i first came here in 2019 (?). fulfills my boba and crepe cravings. also the guy who works there likes anime i vibe w 10/10... and the drinks are SO CHEAP. u get what u get for the price u pay and im satisfied.
if you asked me which i would choose between here and louisa's i would say louisa's. the vibes are okay but i just feel like everything here is overpriced for what they are... but they do have 2 for 1 burritos on tuesdays
idk how they managed to inflate the price of cookies by so much. the cookies arent bad but i would definitely not go out of my way to pay so mf much
so much better than the wingstop downtown. if i crave wings, its buffalo slo.
definitely overlooked when it comes to the abundance of sando options in slo but if you're in the foothill area then this place is worth the walk!
i wanna know how they can mess up chipotle that badly
i've tried the slo and pismo location and both locations are so yum! i love the diner decor/vibe. its definitely a must-try if you get tired of splash cafe!
now i dont go here much for the food but DEFINITELY for the cake! i dont think the food is all that amazing but you should definitely try their seasonal (summer) strawberry cake... it reminds me of asia...
i havent tried the ice cream but i can assure you the cookies are YUM
now i'm a #mcconnells_supremacist but i can't leave doc's out!! its a fun little shop and the decorations are so cute. the ice cream is decent too!
good for hangovers. i would choose dominos over any pizza place (which is my preference) but this location has good service and delivery is quick too. unlike someone next door...
we have our opinions on EPL but i think its rly cute how the target employees sit down and chat there during their lunch break:)
ate it too much freshman year but i do be missing it sometimes... super duper cheap good food and drinks too
SO AMAZING they never disappoint. if you have friends i'd def grab the meters they do on monday, u can try a bit of pretty much anything. fair warning, its fine dining so make sure you have extra cash.
gold tier SSS+ no comment i wanna live there. i wanna BE there. i WANNA.
abe, the owner, is such a man. i swear he knows every single person who has been there and he will give u so much free shit LMAO. he tells you so many interesting things ab his life and most importantly his food is so good. he runs the place alone so it does take a bit of time but i literally dont care if i have to wait. i always eat here when im in morro bay.
this place was so disgusting idk how u can say they have "good food"... sushi rice had way too much vinegar it seems like they dont know what theyre making
my coworker thinks its overrated but he worked there so his opinion doesn't matter. discounts after 4:20 p.m. never go there before 4:20
kind of disappointed to say the least, since other house of bagels isnt this bad. very overpriced for what it is, the hike up to einstein's is probably worth it more than this location.
ike's, for those of you who don't know, is a chain sando place with the most immaculate vibes. one order lasts me a day tbh. they also do student discounts
ice cream is super watered down and i do not recommend. the cookies, however...
gives u the best feeling when u go here drunk or to sober up
dont support r8pists.
kona's would probably be in the middle or a little bit lower than that on the sando tier list but i love the vibes there + make sure u check out kona's week bc theres a lot of sexy discounts
apparently the coffee is bleh (im not a coffee drinker) but i go there for the vibes
tater tots slap more than the drinks itself imo. the daquiri #3, misspelled for some reason, gets a 5.8/10 for not being as fruity as i thought.
i mean not bad but not good. go when splash is closed or youre hungry and youre waiting for the bus after shopping @ TJ's
when this place first opened i went there every week. im not even kidding, i LOVE turkish delights (especially baklavas) and i swear i gained some weight from going there too much. if it's your first time, definitely try their baklavas with some afternoon turkish coffee. not a study-cafe setting.
honestly i think i hyped it up because it was just a normal brekky place. i personally have better places where i'm from but considering their "competition" is dennys and ihop it shall be forgiven.. vibes are immaculate
make sure your date has money
dessert=mcconnells
boycotting bc they dont have the cactus plant flea market meal on doordash
honestly my last choice when i crave boba. the fries are super good tho
it wasnt until this location that i realized all mr pickles locations are different and this location has the best mr pickles sandos. i love how they give u cookies for free too
i might get hate for this but i think this place is overhyped. the ice cream isn't that great (again, i'm a mcconnells believer and supremacist but even with that aside i dont think its delicious) and insanely overpriced. its a bit of a walk but i would hit a different ice cream place, you would be satisfied there paying half the price you would here.
as an L&L enthusiast, i was quite disappointed with what they had to offer. i'll def try to give them a second chance but it was pretty disappointing
some people cried bc they shut club penguin down. i cried bc this place closed.
now that i think ab it maybe i'll just drop my money at giuseppes
this is by far the WORST panda location in the whole world
theres def crack in the food they serve bc i be coming here every week. this place singlehandedly saved slo's miserable ethnic food population
pizzas are intriguing. ill try next time... if you can drive and youre craving mediterranean though, i recommend going to Grape Leaf in morro (844 Main)
its not the best (and i mean it) but i like the people working there
i think i prefer pokichef over pokirito but i def have to go try them again soon!!
my guilty pleasure
exposing myself as being japanese and i got to say this might be the most decent ramen place slo has to offer. the broth is okay, the noodles arent too soggy. i might give them a try since its been 2 years.. i just remember it being v expensive
idk why this place always smells like a baby pissed its diapers in it but they rly need to fix that. they have super overpriced japanese candy but i dont ignore it bc i love the old school vibes :)
owners remind me of my parents. sometimes the place looks like they were robbed, just make sure to call them and see if theyre open before going. i dont recommend the clam chowder
i mean i guess its okay but theres so many good mexican restaurants in town, why go here? not my first choice. i do be missing the precovid unlimited salsa tho
i dont enjoy the lack of diversity in the staff (someone pointed this out and i realized last year) but their pastries are pretty yummy :)
their best decision was to open a store during farmer's and ive been HOOKED ever since. they had to raise the price a bit (uncontrollable) but i still fw
do a 180 and walk to goshi's since you're already downtown. the people working there have no idea what theyre doing (i say this bc i too work at a restaurant) and honestly idk how they still have customers with that service. their daily specials isnt even wowing, but its a good cheap alternative if youre craving "sushi" rather than sushi. my rating is mostly reflective on the service there, but when i got takeout it wasn't much of a problem.
the cutest owner ever, he's so sweet and nice! the only downside is that theyre only open until four but its a hidden cafe and a great spot to study and munch on yummy desserts or sip on a matcha latte. garden st is my fav block downtown :)
i feel like this one's kind of a given, i wouldn't say it's overhyped but it's definitely worth the price. instead of whole donuts tho, i like getting the cronuts and the donut holes + MILK ofc :) it gets too busy so i avoid that place when i need somewhere to study.
only the og's know that we had a froyo place on campus, but i was pretty delighted to find out that a froyo place opened downtown... the people who work there are super chill and the place is open late, yummy froyo and great toppings so 13/10 :) maybe even better than yocrea
too expensive but i go there for the vibe. the employees are super nice and the eating area is super cute, plus a rly clean bathroom. i love hopping from the oriental market, grabbing a ramune, to slo provisions on a sunny afternoon
some people forget about this place because of their competitor, rocket fizz, but i definitely haven't. i prefer supporting this small business over rocket fizz (chain but maybe a small business?). pretty slow on a weekday, bunch of kids on the weekends :)
why do i have to comment when they have everything ? i get sad because they dont do free delivery on doordash but the bus stops right in front of it so i find myself going there a lot
i just found out that the place closed and never came back/changed to slodoco. i love slodoco but i'll forever miss the mom-and-pop vibe + the mass amount of freebies they would give me
this place is actually good. they have good "sushi" and the prices arent even bad
i absolutely LOVE the owners and their variety (they also use plant based milk at default with no charge). it may be a little bit on the expensive side but i'd do anything for those lovely owners. it's not a study-cafe setting, unfortunately, but their trinkets and artifacts they have on display is fun to look at :)
again. gives u the best feeling when u go here drunk or ur trying to sober up. just dont give the employees a hard time
im actually not a big fan of this place. i would eat here while i'm waiting for the bus to come around after a tj's run, but its definitely near the bottom of the tierlist when it comes to mexican cuisine.
dont be fooled. same owners as kin coffee. (refer to kin coffee)
tuesday -> i want taco -> i go here. i swear i was addicted...still am..?
after months of my san miguel addiction, i finally tried this place. i finally understood their hype.
im sure the owners know me at this point and this is where this list was born LOL. i have another spreadsheet of all the drinks i've tried but its just such a great study spot and the employees are always so cool to talk to. my go-to cafe
restaurant setting so i dont rly go there besides doordashing it but its my second choice if papas is closed
isnt it so funny how your childhood fast food places become hangover food once youre in college
my vegan friend buys her veggie burrito once a week here. i think thats very telling.
broke my heart when they were out of gorditas. insulted.
catch me eating at this place 5 meals a day... also a GREAT study spot since its not overcrowded like a coffee cafe, but not too restaurant to be sitting there awkwardly doing work. employees are super chill too
not the best location taste-wise but i give it credit bc its open late-night.
a millionaire's little cesar's. i wont deny the fact its decent but its not worth the price you pay. im driving to domino's
a strange man downtown sang to me that they have the best shakes in town. (i go here religiously and own their t-shirts)
